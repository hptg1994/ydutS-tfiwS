 ## Switch
 - Note: In contrast with switch statements in C and Objective-C, switch statements in Swift do not fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one by default. Instead, the entire switch statement finishes its execution as soon as the first matching switch case is completed, without requiring an explicit break statement. This makes the switch statement safer and easier to use than the one in C and avoids executing more than one switch case by mistake.

 ### fall through
 因为在Switch语句里面，匹配到了就不会继续执行了（就相当于break）,但是如果我们想让他继续执行，看下下面的还有没有匹配的，用fallthrough
